## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to use Tableau to display data visualizations for Citbike usage stats from New York for August 2019 as an example to prepare a visualization of data to determine the feasibility of launching Citbike in a small town.

## Analysis
As we see in the visualization for August Peak Hours and Trips by Weekday per Hour, 8-9 am and 4-7 pm are times of peak usage. And with the heat maps breaking down User Trips by Gender by Weekday and Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) we see males are primarily the ones renting bikes, and Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday are the busiest days. And of the total count shown in Number of Rides (2,344,224), we see most are subscribers with close to 2 million of the rides being by subscribers, and over 1.5 million of the 2.3 million being male. Furthermore, we see an increase of Average Trip Duration as the average age decreases.

## Conclusion
Given the info we have, it would be best to target advertising, especially for subscription, at males aged 18-35 as that seems to be the key demographic for Citbike. Two additional visualizations I recommend performing in future analysis are Trips by Weekday per Hour by Age, and also checkout times by age. Those 2 visualizations would provide further analysis to more precisely target advertising.
